Lager ``NPY_MAXDIMS`` and ``NPY_MAXARGS``, ``NPY_RAVEL_AXIS`` introduced
------------------------------------------------------------------------

``NPY_MAXDIMS`` is now 64, you may want to review its use.  This is usually
used in a stack allocation, where the increase should be safe.
However, we do encourage generally to remove any use of ``NPY_MAXDIMS`` and
``NPY_MAXARGS`` to eventually allow removing the constraint completely.
In some cases, ``NPY_MAXDIMS`` was passed (and returned) to mean ``axis=None``
these must be replaced with ``NPY_RAVEL_AXIS``.
