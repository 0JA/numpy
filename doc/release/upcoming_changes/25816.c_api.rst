* The dtype flags on ``PyArray_Descr`` must now be accessed through the
  ``PyDataType_FLAGS` inline function to be compatible with both 1.x and 2.x.
  This function is defined in ``npy_2_compat.h`` to allow backporting.
  Most or all users should use ``PyDataType_FLAGCHK`` which is available on
  1.x and does not require backporting.
  *Cython* users should use Cython 3.  Otherwise access will go through Python
  unless they use ``PyDataType_FLAGCHK`` instead.
