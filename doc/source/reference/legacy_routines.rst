Legacy Routines
***************

In this chapter legacy routine docstrings are presented, grouped by
functionality. Legacy routines are routines that are part of the NumPy
source tree, but are planned to be deprecated, either in a specified
version or an unspecified point in the future.

Many docstrings contain example code, which demonstrates basic usage
of the routine. The examples assume that NumPy is imported with::

  >>> import numpy as np

A convenient way to execute examples is the ``%doctest_mode`` mode of
IPython, which allows for pasting of multi-line examples and preserves
indentation.
