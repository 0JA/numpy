``__array_prepare__`` is deprecated
-----------------------------------
UFuncs called ``__array_prepare__`` before running computations
for normal ufunc calls (not generalized ufuncs, reductions, etc.).
The function was also called instead of ``__array_wrap__`` on the
results of some linear algebra functions.

It is now deprecated, if you use it (e.g. old unit implementations)
migrate to ``__array_function__``.
If you implemented it, but the function does very little,
``__array_wrap__`` will still be called and can handle any type
conversion necessary.  In any case where ``__array_prepare__``
is now gone, ``__array_wrap__`` is passed the ``context != None``.

.. note::
   There is one additional subtlety.  Previously, ``__array_wrap__``
   was more often already passed a subclass, while ufuncs will now
   always pass a base-class array.  (Some python functions may pass
   subclasses though.)
